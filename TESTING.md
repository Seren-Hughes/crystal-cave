# Development Troubleshooting


During development, I encountered several issues with layout positioning and game logic errors. Below are the problems I faced and the solutions implemented.

## Bat Sprite and Level Number Positioning

### Issue:
- The bat sprite was too close to the crystal container on smaller screens and required many adjustments.
- The level number was positioned awkwardly on smaller screens, requiring too many adjustments.

### Cause: 
While media queries were functional, they lacked efficiency, leading to unnecessary repositioning at different breakpoints.

### Solution:
- Implemented a responsive wrapper for the bat sprite and level number, allowing them to scale and adjust dynamically based on screen size.
- Optimised media queries by reducing redundancy and focusing on key breakpoints.

### Testing Results:
Below is a screenshot of the DevTools Flexbox grid showing the updated layout/wrapper adjustments:

# Uncaught ReferenceError: sequence is not defined

### Issue:
During testing, an error appeared in the console:

```Uncaught ReferenceError: sequence is not defined at HTMLDivElement.handleCrystalClick.```

### Cause:
The issue was caused by using the target property in the handleCrystalClick function. The target property refers to the element that triggered the event, which could be a child element of the crystal container. This caused the function to fail when trying to access properties or methods on the wrong element, leading to the 'sequence is not defined' error.

### Solution:
The fix involved switching from target to currentTarget. The currentTarget property always refers to the element to which the event listener is attached, ensuring that the correct crystal container is targeted.

**Code Before Fix:**

`let clickedColor = event.target.dataset.color; // Incorrect: target could refer to a child element`

**Code After Fix:**

`let clickedColor = event.currentTarget.dataset.color; // Correct: currentTarget refers to the crystal container`

### Why This Works:
Using currentTarget ensures that the handleCrystalClick function always interacts with the correct crystal container, regardless of which child element triggered the event. This resolved the sequence is not defined error and allowed the game logic to proceed as expected.

### Testing Results:
After implementing the fix, the error no longer appeared in the console. The game correctly identified the clicked crystal and updated the player's input sequence. Screenshots of the console logs before and after the fix are included below:
