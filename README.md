## Design & Planning:

### Game Overview:
Echoes of the Crystal Cave is a memory-based puzzle game where players help Brucey the bat navigate a mysterious cave filled with glowing, musical crystals. Players must watch and listen to and repeat sequences of notes to progress, while enjoying a dynamic audio-visual experience.

### Concept:
Help Brucey the bat remember the sequence of crystals. 

### Game Mechanics:
#### Controls:
- **Mouse Click** – Click on the crystals to play their notes.
- **Touch Screen Tap** – Tap crystals on mobile for touch interaction.
- **Keyboard Keys (A, W, S, E, D)** – Alternative input for accessibility.
#### Visual & Audio Cues:
- Crystals glow in different colours when activated.
- Each crystal plays a distinct note in a five-note scale.
- Correct sequence all crystals glow and a rewarding sound plays before the next level sequence starts.
- Incorrect sequence results in modal pop up with encouraging 'try again' messages (_could have random inspiring messages_) and option to play again yes/no buttons. 

#### Win Conditions:
- Successfully repeat the full sequence to advance to the next round.

#### Lose Conditions:
- In Hard/Default Mode, a single mistake results in a game over. 
- _(could have feature)_ Easy Mode, players have three chances before restarting.

#### Could have features:
- **Easter egg** - Player name input. If name is equal to Brucey, Brucey the bat changes colour or wears a hat. 

#### Level Design & Sequence Length:
1. Level 1 = sequence of 3
2. Level 2 = sequence of 4
3. Level 3 = sequence of 5 
... and so on.
