Echoes of the Crystal Cave is a memory-based puzzle game where players help Brucey the bat navigate a mysterious cave filled with glowing, musical crystals. Players must watch and listen to and repeat sequences of notes to progress, while enjoying a dynamic audio-visual experience.

### Concept:
This game takes the classic Simon memory challenge and gives it a unique twist with a cave setting, atmospheric audio, and a five-note scale system. Players interact with glowing crystals that light up and produce musical tones when activated. The game is designed to be accessible, engaging, and visually appealing, with pixel-art aesthetics and simple, responsive controls.

#### Visual & Audio Cues:
